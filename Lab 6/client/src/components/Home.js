                This is a Pokémon Repository by Vatsal Shah. You can find all the Pokémons here and add them to your own trainer's teams(max 6 Pokémons). You can even search for individual Pokémon. 
                It basically makes API calls to the PokéAPI and fetches the different Pokémons. You can test these features by going to the pages
                in the Navbar. You can come back to this page by clicking on the name of the website on the top-left.
